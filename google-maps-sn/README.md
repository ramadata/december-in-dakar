Dakar in December is a busy time for many expats, tourists, business owners, etc. and during my vacation I realized that some locations were available on Google Maps, but others were not. Dakar doesn't have plentiful street signs like New York, Paris, or London. People give directions by using other larger and well-known large places as a reference. Business owners lose money when patrons cannot locate your business and getting lost in a foreign country is 100% not it.

Taxis are the main method of transport and takes up a large share of the transport sector. Currently, the rental car business is expanding and if you are someone whose family has a car you don't have the need for taxis. Not to mention locals can immediately discern between tourists vacationers/immigrants so taking a taxi also means paying the tourist tax. Because of that, I decided to create a map where contributors can add locations and hopefully in the future navigating Dakar becomes easier.
